# An Automatic Traffic Lights System Using Pygame
Software engineering project. Authors:  Xavier Beltran Urbano, Luisana Alvarez Monsalve,  Andrew Dwi Permana

## Project description
Traffic lights, often known as traffic signals, manage road traffic for pedestrians, automobiles, and other road users. The aim of this project is to recreate the functionality of an automatic traffic light system using Python. This project requires duties such as:

1. Simulate the operation of a traffic light
2. Simulate the operation of a pedestrian light
3. Detect if a car is in violation or not
4. Detect if a pedestrian is in violation
5. Display a message if there is a violation
   
The module that we have used in this project is mainly Pygame.
