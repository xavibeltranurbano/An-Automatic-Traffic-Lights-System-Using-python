    Attributes
   -------------
    vecVehicles : vector of Vehicle()
         This vector stores all the vehicles of the traffic.
    copy_vecVehicles : vector of Vehicle()
         This vector is a copy of the initial vecVehicles vector. It is used to add new vehicles in the same initial position of the several vehicles of the vecVehicles vector.
    vec_Traffic_Light : vector of Traffic_Light()
         This vector stores all the vehicle Traffic_Lights of the traffic.
    vec_Traffic_Light_Pedestrian : vector of Traffic_Light()
         This vector stores all the pedestrian Traffic_Lights of the traffic.
    vec_Pedestrian : vector of Pedestrian()
         This vector stores all the pedestrians in the traffic.
    stop_lines : vector of points (x,y)
         This vector stores the position of the points at which the vehicles have to stop.
    tl_position : int
        PROBABLY WE WILL HAVE TO REMOVE THIS VARIABLE
    infraction : boolean
        This variable is used to know when the infractions are done (default False).
    coordx : int
        This variable is used to put a display message (when an infraction is done) in the "x" corresponding position (default 0).
    coordy : int
        This variable is used to put a display message (when an infraction is done) in the "y" corresponding position (default 0).
    rot_points : vector of points (x,y)
        This vector stores the position of the points at which the vehicles have to turn.
